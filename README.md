<h1>About</h1>

<p align="justify"> This project, which I prepared in the 1st year of university, was a Responsive website. I designed a simple website inspired by photographers' blogs. In this work, I used "Bootstrap, JQuery, CSS and JavaScript". I'm leaving a video below for your superficial review. By the way, the photos on the website are completely mine, as much as I love coding, I also love taking photos :) You can watch the video by clicking the image below.</p>
